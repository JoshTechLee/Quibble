# Since we are running only one day, we have to account for events that already exist.  Since we cannot mingle with a created event in another session within the same day, this is a necessity.  Thus, the program will reset everything into a specific day scenario and run the scripts as follows.

# Note: since there was an error that did not allow scripts to be run as intended, the program removed the "continue day" feature to work around the error.



# reset everything to run the daily script again
bash ./DailyScripts/dailyReset

if [ ! -d "transactions" ]; then
   mkdir transactions
fi

# the "continue day" feature removed to run 5 sessions separately
